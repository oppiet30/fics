Usage: decline [1-n, match, draw, adjourn, abort,
                takeback, switch, simul, all, player]

  Decline an offer that is made to you. If no parameter is given and
there is only one offer, you decline it. If there is more than one
offer (for example multiple match offers) then you must specify
which one you don't want. You can either choose it by number, by type,
all offers, or by the player's name making the offer.

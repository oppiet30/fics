  Wild is a little different than the other catagories of boards in that
they are generated dynamically.

  1:  In this variant both sides have the same set of pieces as in
      normal chess.  The white king starts on d1 or e1 and the black
      king starts on d8 or e8, and the rooks are in their usual positions.
      Bishops are always on opposite colors.  Subject to these constraints
      the position is random.  Castling is similar to normal chess:
      o-o-o indicates long castling and o-o short castling.

  2:  Here the usual set of pieces is arranged randomly on the first
      and eighth ranks.  Black's arrangement is always a mirror image
      of White's.  Castling is not allowed.

  3:  Here the set of pieces itself is randomly chosen (subject to the
      constraint that there is one king of each color).  Black's pieces
      mirror White's, and castling is not allowed.

  4:  A random set of pieces is generated.  These are placed randomly for
      white and black, subject to the constraint that the bishops must
      be balanced.

  5:  Surprise.

Usage: alias [word [string]]

  Sets up a command alias so that "word" is equivalent to typing "string".
If "string" is omitted then the current value of "word" is displayed. If
both paramenters are omitted, then all of your aliases are displayed.

  Note: Aliases are not transitive. This sequence:

    alias foo bar
    alias bar baz

  will NOT result in "foo" being equivalent to "baz".

Standard aliases (everyone has these by default):
  a             accept
  exit          quit
  f             finger
  logout        quit
  m             match
  p             who a
  players       who a
  sh            shout
  t             tell
  vars          variables
  w             who
  .             tell .
  ,             tell ,
  !             shout
  :             it
  ?             query

Usage: courtesyabort

  If your opponent's flag has hit zero, this is a one sided abort
command. It is intended to abort the game if your opponent has gone
net-dead or has terrible lag. It is considered good sportsmanship
to do this rather than claim a win on time when your opponent doesn't
have a fighting chance.

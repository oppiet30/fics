Usage: match user [[Start] [Inc] [Black_Start Black_Inc] board_catagory board]

  Requests a match with a given user. The resmaining paramenters specify
the time controls of the match. If none are given then a '2 12' match
is specified. If only 'Start' is given then 'Inc' is assumend to be zero.
If a time is given for Black then the original requestor of the match
will play the White side, otherwise the side will be chosen "fairly".

  Start's are given in minutes, and Inc's in seconds.

  The final parameters can only be given after all of the other parameters. They specify the starting position for the game. If they are not supplied then "standard" and "standard" are used.

  Here are some examples that may help:

  Requests a 5 minute blitz match with red.

match red 30 30
  Requests a 30 minute match with 30 second increments with red.

match red 30 0 15 0

match red 2 12 0 0 openings ruy-lupez

  If a game request is already pending from that user, and the time controls
agree, then the match will start, otherwise a new proposal will be made.

  It is my hope that the source code to quality chess server software
will be available to the internet community for free. It could be the
FICS, the ICS, or some other new software, it doesn't matter.

  When Michael Moore started the chess server years ago, it was his
intention to provide free access to it to everyone. He distributed the
server code freely in the hope that server sites might spring up and
flourish. Unfortunately, the situation exists today where one small
group of people have hoarded the source code and refuse to allow
any alternate servers start. I hope that my efforts in re-writing
a public domain server has the effect to improve the server, both in
substance and in administration.

  If the FICS catches on and replaces the ICS (unlikely), then we win. If
the ICS is released as source code to the public and the FICS dies, then
we win. If the FICS and ICS go on coexisting perhaps someday sharing the
same ratings server, we win.

  The only way we lose is if the status-quo is maintained and the only
source of internet chess is controlled by a few individuals.

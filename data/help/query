Usage: query message

  Displays your message to all users regardless if they are open to here
shout's or not. This command can only be used twice per hour. It is
intended to allow you to make serious inquiries, not the meaningless
ramblings that 'shout'ing has turned into. Returns the number of users
who heard your query. Query can be abbreviated with '?'.

    ? Where do I get xboard?
and
    query Where do I get xboard?
are equivalent.

  To play simul's you need to do the following.

1. Turn on your simopen flag with "simopen".

2. Others must chalange you with "simmatch"

3. You accept or reject the chalanges as they come in. You play WHITE in
   all games.

4. When you are satisfied that you have started the number of games
   that you can handle, turn off your simopen flag. You can see how
   many games you are playing with "simgames".

5. You can then start making moves on the board. The "simnext" command
   moves you to the next board.

6. If a player is taking too long to move for your tastes, you can abort
   that game with "simabort". You are in control.

7. When all boards are complete, you will get your results.

  To play against a simul

1. Chalange the person who will be playing, when accepted you will be
   playing BLACK.

2. You will be informed when the simul player is coming to your board. You
   should be prepared to move either before or shortly after that player
   arrives at your board. If you do not move, you could be aborted.

3. It is impolite to offer a draw unless that player is at your board. It
   could very easily confuse the simul player if offers come in from all
   around the table.

4. If your game ends early, you may want to turn on your ginform flag
   so that you can see the final result.

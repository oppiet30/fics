Usage: flag

  If your opponent has run out of time, and you have not, you get
the win. If both players are out of time, then it is a draw.

  If your opponent appears to have lost contact or hasn't responed
in a reasonable amount of time, they probably have lag. Use
"courtesyabort" to end the game like a good sport.

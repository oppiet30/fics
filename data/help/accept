Usage: accept [1-n, draw, adjourn, abort, takeback, all]

  Accepts an offer that is made to you. If no parameter is given and
there is only one offer, you accept it. If there is more than one
offer (for example multiple match offers) then you must specify
which one you want. You can either choose it by number, or by type
if the type is draw, adjourn, abort, or takeback. "All" accepts all
pending offeres.

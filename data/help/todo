There are plenty of things to do on the server. Here is a list.

1. The who command is lame and needs to be reworked.

2. Help should have partial word as well as wildcard matching.

3. Help should also be better organized. Lists should be catagorized.

4. The output move format is computer algebraic. An algabraic de-parser
   is needed.

5. Messages.

Any more???

If you wish to work on any of these things just get the code. It is
free.

  You can get the most recent code via anonymous ftp to 'ftp.visus.com'
in the directory /pub/FICS.

  If you make any changes you would like to see incorporated into the
future releases, please mail them to nash@visus.com. I'm hoping that
the FICS community will help improve and debug this server.
